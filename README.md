# Design Hub Website
The first iteration of Pitt's Design Hub website. Design Hub is about students building solutions to real-world problems in and around the University of Pittsburgh. We are driven by design principles and strive for interdisciplinary collaboration and hands-on experiences. Get in touch at hi@pittdesignhub.com.

This website is open-source (license TBD). Design Hub logo created by Madhur Malhotra.

### Getting started
Thanks for contributing! See some resources below for gettings started. No prior experience needed.
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) The SCM-client-of-choice for this project (and GitHub!). You may use the GitHub GUI ([Windows](https://windows.github.com/) / [Mac](https://mac.github.com/)) for this project, but command-line interfaces (CLI) are more OS agnostic.  Give it a demo [here](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
  - Also consult the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/), particularly the [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) explanation.
